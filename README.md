# eCommerce Transactions Dataset - Data Science Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for an eCommerce Data Science Assignment. The goal of the assignment is to perform data analysis, build predictive models, and generate actionable business insights based on the provided dataset consisting of three files:

1. `Customers.csv`
2. `Products.csv`
3. `Transactions.csv`

The tasks are divided into three main sections:

- **Task 1:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights.
- **Task 2:** Lookalike Model.
- **Task 3:** Customer Segmentation using Clustering techniques.

## Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- **Objective:** Perform EDA on the provided dataset and derive at least 5 business insights.
- **Deliverables:**
  - `Rohit_Rajput_EDA.pdf`: A PDF report summarizing the business insights.
  - `Rohit_Rajput_EDA.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the EDA code.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective:** Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Deliverables:**
  - `Rohit_Rajput_Lookalike.csv`: A CSV file mapping CustomerID to similar customer IDs along with their similarity scores.
  - `Rohit_Rajput_Lookalike.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the Lookalike Model development and code.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Objective:** Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on both customer profile and transaction information.
- **Deliverables:**
  - `Rohit_Rajput_Clustering.pdf`: A PDF report summarizing the clustering results, including DB Index and other metrics.
  - `Rohit_Rajput_Clustering.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the customer segmentation (clustering) code.
